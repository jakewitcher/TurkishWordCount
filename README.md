# Turkish Word Count

This application counts the number of times a word is used in a Turkish text. It attempts to count words based on the root word rather than on competely unique words, so a text with the word "insanlarla" and "insanlar" would return a count of 2 for the root word "insan". As more rules are added to the application, it will more intelligiently group and count words by their root.
